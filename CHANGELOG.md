## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-09

### 🚀 Major Changes

#### Rebranding to Kinetic
- Project renamed from "DAST Security Scanner" to **Kinetic** (`@tzigger/kinetic`)
- CLI command changed to `kinetic`
- Complete documentation overhaul to reflect new branding
- Updated all package references and configuration files

#### Element Scanner
- Added specialized `ElementScanner` for focused testing of individual DOM elements via locators
- Support for `ElementScanConfig` to target specific inputs/forms without crawling
- Integration with `DomExplorer` for precise attack surface identification

### 🛠 Improvements

#### Test Suite Cleanup
- Removed obsolete and duplicate test files
- Fixed TypeScript errors in remaining tests
- Improved test reliability and organization

#### Active Verification System
- **VerificationEngine**: Orchestrator for vulnerability verification
  - Support for 4 verification levels: NONE, BASIC, STANDARD, FULL
  - Confidence scoring (0-1) based on verification results
  - Automatic false positive filtering
  
- **TimeBasedVerifier**: Verification via timing analysis
  - Baseline measurement with multiple samples
  - Statistical detection of delays (SQL SLEEP, Command injection sleep)
  - Reduced false positives for time-based SQLi

- **ResponseDiffVerifier**: Verification via response comparison
  - Boolean-based payload pairs (true/false conditions)
  - Error pattern detection
  - XSS reflection verification

- **ReplayVerifier**: Basic verification via payload re-execution

#### Timeout Handling System
- **TimeoutManager**: Intelligent timeout management
  - Strategies: FIXED, ADAPTIVE, SPA_AWARE
  - Adaptive learning from response patterns
  - Per-operation timeout configuration
  - Progress tracking with callbacks
  - Abort controller for long-running operations

- **SPAWaitStrategy**: Specific strategies for SPA frameworks
  - Automatic framework detection: Angular, React, Vue, Svelte
  - Angular: Zone.js stability detection
  - React: Scheduler idle / requestIdleCallback
  - Vue: Vue.nextTick completion
  - DOM mutation observer fallback

#### New Types
- `verification.ts`: Types for the verification system
  - VerificationLevel, VerificationStatus, VerificationConfig
  - VerificationResult, VerificationAttempt
  - IVulnerabilityVerifier interface

- `timeout.ts`: Types for timeout handling
  - TimeoutStrategy, OperationType, SPAFramework
  - TimeoutConfig, AdaptiveTimeoutState
  - SPAStabilityResult, SPAWaitCondition

### 📈 Metric Improvements
| Metric | v0.1 | v0.2 Target |
|--------|------|-------------|
| False Positive Rate | ~15% | < 5% |
| Detection Confidence | 50-60% | > 80% |
| SPA Test Success Rate | ~70% | > 95% |
| Timeout Rate | ~25% | < 5% |

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2025-11-24

### 🎉 Initial Beta Release

The first public beta release of Playwright Security! This release includes core DAST scanning capabilities with Playwright integration.

### ✨ Added

#### Core Framework
- **ScanEngine**: Orchestration engine with parallel scanner execution
- **BrowserManager**: Playwright browser lifecycle management
- **ConfigurationManager**: JSON-based configuration with validation

#### Active Scanner
- **ActiveScanner**: Form-based vulnerability testing with payload injection
- **DomExplorer**: Intelligent attack surface discovery
- **PayloadInjector**: Smart payload injection with 1s timeout optimization

#### Detectors (Phase 3)
- **SqlInjectionDetector**: Comprehensive SQL injection detection
  - Error-based detection
  - Boolean-based blind SQL injection
  - Time-based blind SQL injection
  - Union-based SQL injection
  - CWE-89 | OWASP A03:2021

- **XssDetector**: Cross-site scripting detection
  - Reflected XSS
  - Stored XSS  
  - DOM-based XSS
  - CWE-79 | OWASP A03:2021

- **ErrorBasedDetector**: Information disclosure detection
  - Stack traces
  - Database errors
  - Path disclosure
  - Debug information
  - CWE-209 | OWASP A05:2021

#### Reporters (Phase 4)
- **ConsoleReporter**: Real-time colored output with ora spinner + chalk
- **JsonReporter**: Machine-readable JSON format
- **HtmlReporter**: Beautiful HTML reports with Handlebars templates
- **SarifReporter**: SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub Security integration

#### CLI (Phase 5)
- Command-line interface with Commander.js
- `--config` flag for JSON configuration files
- Multiple output formats: `--formats console,json,html,sarif`
- Parallel execution: `--parallel <n>`
- Binary: `kinetic` command

#### Playwright Integration
- **Testing Helpers**: `runActiveSecurityScan()`, `runPassiveSecurityScan()`, `assertNoVulnerabilities()`
- Example test files in `examples/` directory
- Support for inline security testing

#### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflow for SARIF upload
- Example workflows in `examples/`
- Automated NPM publishing on release

### 🚀 Performance
- 1-second timeout for element interactions (down from 30s)
- Selector-first approach (avoids stale element handles)
- Configurable parallelism (default: 2 concurrent scanners)
- Debug-level logging for failed injections (reduces noise)

### 📊 Coverage
- **CWE Coverage**: 3/250 (12%) - Initial set
  - CWE-89: SQL Injection
  - CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting
  - CWE-209: Information Exposure Through Error Messages

### 📚 Documentation
- Comprehensive README with quick start
- Example configuration files
- Playwright test integration examples
- GitHub Actions CI/CD examples
- JSDoc comments on core APIs

### 🔧 Configuration
- JSON-based configuration files
- Environment-specific configs (dev, staging, prod)
- CLI args override config file values
- Default config in `config/default.config.json`

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- TypeScript-first with full type definitions
- ESLint + Prettier configuration
- Jest for unit & integration tests
- Playwright for E2E tests
- NPM scripts for common tasks

### ⚙️ Technical Details
- **Node.js**: >=18.0.0
- **TypeScript**: 5.3
- **Playwright**: 1.56
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (commander, chalk, ora, handlebars, winston, uuid)

### 🐛 Known Issues
- Passive scanner not yet fully implemented
- Limited to Chromium browser (Firefox/WebKit support planned)
- Authentication support limited to config-based
- Single-page scanning only (crawling basic)
